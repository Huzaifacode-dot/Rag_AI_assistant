I am teaching DSA data structures and algorithms course for placement preparation.
Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, and the text of the chunk.

Chunks:
[{"title":"Operations on Arrays in Data Structures\uff1a Traversal, Insertion, Deletion and Searching","number":"09","start":137.0,"end":152.0,"text":" I will show you the simple form loop.  Now if I tell you the definition of traversal.  If you ask me what is traversal?  I will not say this.  Now I will tell you the meaning of traversal."},{"title":"Coding Insertion Operation in Array in Data Structures in C language","number":"10","start":103.0,"end":116.0,"text":" As I told you before, I will not tell you the Traversal.  If you want, I will tell you the Traversal.  It is an address.  There are 4 elements.  There is a 4 loop."},{"title":"Coding Insertion Operation in Array in Data Structures in C language","number":"10","start":746.0,"end":760.0,"text":" Here, it is the root of the traversal.  And here, it is the root of insertion.  So, I will write this as traversal.  Code for traversal.  And I will write this as code for insertion."},{"title":"Operations on Arrays in Data Structures\uff1a Traversal, Insertion, Deletion and Searching","number":"09","start":462.14,"end":471.14,"text":" In traversal,  we will use 5-4,  we will use all the elements.  We will use them all.  So what can you do?"},{"title":"Operations on Arrays in Data Structures\uff1a Traversal, Insertion, Deletion and Searching","number":"09","start":76.0,"end":91.0,"text":" Now the traversal is easier to do.  The second one is 2mdb2.  This is the first time I have come here.  But I have to tell you the name of the traversal.  I will not discuss the traversal."}]

User Question:
"where is traversal explained"

Please use ONLY the information in these chunks to answer the question.
Mention the video title and timestamp in your answer.
If you don't know the answer, say you don't know.
If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the content of the videos.
