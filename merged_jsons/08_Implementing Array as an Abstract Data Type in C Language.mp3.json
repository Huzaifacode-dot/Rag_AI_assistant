You will get a C in 1 video after you go to the channel Because it is 15 hours You will search this video For the C language tutorial for beginners in Hindi with notes I have given notes in C case, I have already told you all the things I will assume that you guys are set up and ready Because I want to get the course from the algorithm And I want to make the whole summary of this That you guys have a very limited time And you guys want to use your time With that said, what I will do to you I will make a new file in my VS Code Which name I will name it Edt.C And I will name it as ARA Edt.C You guys can use any valid file I am writing ARA Edt.C So that you guys know what I wrote in the code And I will do one more Here my video number is 8 So I will do 0.8 underscore And precisely you will know what code I wrote in the video number So 0.8 underscore ARA Edt.C I have written here If you guys have given me the playlist access Click here and save the bookmark And before we move on, I want to say thank you so much To all of you who have shared this playlist I have tacked everyone If you are not on Instagram, you can take the link of my Instagram And follow me on Instagram And we will do a lot of things for you So I have made a boilerplate code of Snippet in my VS Code So I write the C boilerplate code here And this is automatically written here If you guys don't know where this boilerplate code is How to get it? You can refer this video to this I have told you in the beginning In the beginning of the 2-3 minutes You guys will see And you will get it I will also start coding here And I will also start coding here And I will also start coding here So what I will do now First of all, I want to make a structure And I will use the structure for structure And I will show you my custom area And you guys can name it What is this? This is my structure It is used to make custom data types And for the ARA Edt You can use C++ You can use a class You can make a class And you can define the methods And you can do a lot of things But I will also define the methods And I have used C language And I have used C language And I have also learned a lot With bare bone programming From the ground to the very top of the peak I will learn C language And I will learn data structures So what I will do here My ARA is Total size And I will use my size So use size What does it mean? So I have told you To open your OneNote notebook And I will show you What I did here You guys told me That our ARA We will make it bigger And we will save the rest of the elements And later use If I have given the size of ARA Then I can use Only 3 integer blocks And if I am using 3 integer blocks Then I can use the rest of the three How can I use the rest of the three I can insert the three in this ARA Like I want to insert the rest of the three in the index number one So I will give these two elements And I will insert the three elements And I will insert them here One more important thing is You can insert the end here But if you want to insert Only in one position You can insert the end here And you can make it bigger And you can make it bigger In ARA So this is the point Now I will make the ARA In total size I told you I will use the size of the memory To be reserved I will keep this in the house As you go in the train And you are walking with the five people You are going to take water This block is coming So you have to sit on the seat So let's say This seat is reserved This seat will come You cannot use this block You can compare it with the train's reservation And you are going from Barreli to Muradabad to Delhi And you are going from Barreli to Delhi And you are going from Boreli to Muradabad to Delhi So if you are going from Muradabad to Delhi And you are going from Barreli to Muradabad You will get that seat on the seat Because he has reserved So all the memory blocks So we will reserve them So in the same way I have reserved them If I have to study the seat So this seat is my own I will not give any other seat on the seat So the compiler will understand You have reserved the six elements So if you leave the three empty seats Then the compiler will not give any other data storage And you guys say I have so many sizes I have so many Excessive memory I used that, that is not good Sometimes you should not think That every user has a lot of memory You have to use it with very few Because memory is the only thing The one who is using the most The one who is optimizing the most The one who is optimizing the most Like if you are eating a lot of food Then you will have to eat more food You will have to eat more food But the users will not be able to see the experience The team of Google Chrome They will have some decisions In the program of Chrome.TXC In the program of Chrome.TXC They have created some strategy They have used a strategy How much memory have you ever eaten It is your favorite Like that, the coding is written What I am going to try To make an array I will have a total size But I will use it Use it I am going to store the marks of my children and here I am going to show you my custom my array abstract ADD first of all I am putting the total size here I am putting the U size then I will tell you that I will also put an INSTAR pointer which I will put in PTR what is PTR? PTR points my array's first element like if I take this array then I will point the arrow and this is the three I have left and this is the par my array because the compiler has the memory of the array it is reserved for another time if your seat number is 0,1,2,3,4,5 you have done a reservation of any seat in that train when you go to train, it becomes a chart then you say that you give me 6 please give me the seat you can not get it yes if you are talking to someone or you are taking the ticket then you can get another seat if you are not taking the ticket yes if your seat number is very good then you may get it you understand that you have not got a guarantee many people say you have got it you have done a 100 times program and you get the continuous memory location but the chances of it are very less if you want the continuous block and you know the need of the continuous block then you have to reserve more elements you have to reserve more block and you can use it I am making a such a ADT which is the first to point the element I have made this ADT I will do this to make this ADT I will show you a link to this I will show you a link to this instance I will show you I will zoom out zoom out I will show you my array I have made a array I have made a array I have made a array if you go inside you will have to use the total size and the pointer to do this I will write a function which I will say I will say create array and what will create array will take a structure which type will it take my array will take the structure in fact, I will pass it I have written struct my array star which is the end star struct my array star I have made a difference that the integer is the primitive data type I am defining some methods and the memory representation I defined them from my own I can also use some other implementation but I have to implement it you can see I have written the function inside I can use it I have this structure this is the pointer I will do this I will do a D reference I will do a D reference the star A will be the value of the star the structure will be the mark I have passed and the structure will be the dot I can access and I will do T size I will do T size I will do T size I will do T size I will do T size I will do T size I will do T size I will do T size I will set the pointer I will explain it what I have done I have done what is the create array I will call the creator I have not done the creator I am giving it I have made a structure mark I will do T size I am giving it I can see I am giving it I am using it I am using it I have used it I have used it I will do the address I have a struct my array and I have a pointer this is the address I have written it in a way and I will use it to save the controller and the renderer will come because the error is saved everything is fixed I have saved the controller and set the use size I will do I will write int star I will write int star I will change the pointer I will write it because I want to give the integer pointer int star melok you will get the size of the total size I want to take it from the heap I will write it T size int because my integer is not good so what will we do? we will return the integer pointer to that memory block I have reserved the heap the size of the memory block is 100 I have created a stack of the heap I have created a heap I have zoomed it I have reserved the heap and it has a syntax and it has a syntax and it will return a pointer to that heap to that you will get the size of the the heap I have set the size I will use it I will add the insert operation I will see I will use the Bs block and return I want the structure of the PTR is set I will copy it and paste it I will write the PTR I will set the structure of the PTR and the memory of the memory I will create a function I will create this area you can use C++ you can use Constructor you can use the class but I want to create a method to create a method to create a structure which is a pointer to address a structure I have passed the address and after that you can use it for the time being you can use the Bs you have passed the structure you have given the address you have given I have set the D reference you have given the address you have given you have given the structure you have given it you have given the structure you can use it for your structure address if you need the structure I have given the address I have given it This structure is also in this style when you choose the value The value of the address is the star and the ampersand is the address of the operator. Now we have a shortcut. If I don't use this shortcut, I won't do it. But for the shortcut, you can make an arrow operator for ease. I have read all these in my C course. You can write it in the C course. I have commented on the C course. You can see the C course below. It is identical. You put a star and a bracket and a dot. You can put an arrow in it. If I compile this program, I will compile it. You have used the Melog, but the studyLiB dot H is not included. I have not done the studyLiB dot H. I am not doing anything in this program. I am just making an arrow. I will do one more. I have made an arrow in this arrow. I have made an arrow in it. I have made an arrow in it. I have given a pointer. What will I do? I will point the memory block first. I have made an instance of this structure. What I have done here? I have made a mark of this data type variable. I have made a structure variable. Now what I will do? I want to create a circle. This is just a information. It has not done memory reserve in actual. What has only done here? I have done the total size memory reserve. I have done the use size memory reserve. I have done the pretty memory reserve. But I do not want the memory reserve in the dynamic. I have to call a create array function. What will I do? I will give the size memory request. What will I do? I will update the pointer. This is not a return function. Now I want to make a show function. I will make a void show function. I will make a struct my array. I will make a array. I will make a array type of array. Now what I will do? I will make a void loop. I will make a void loop. I will make a void loop. I will make a void loop. I don't want the total size. I will display the elements used in this array. I will display them. I don't want any problem here. So you can see here. I want to start my array. I will pass the pointer. Now what is the problem? My array has no... Okay, the use size is not here. So... Now let's use the size of this function. It was a variable. I have made a local variable of this function. I am passing it to 100 and 20. As t size and as u size. But structure may total size and u size. Total under size and use under size. It is represented by the use under size. So now what I have done in the show function. I have made a one. I am making a U size. I will write a print. I will write a D after writing a print. And what I will do here. I will show the element here. I will do a backslash and also write. And what I will write here. This is my array. Where is my PTR in my concept pointer. So I will do this PTR. What I will do is the pointer. I will use this pointer. I will use this pointer. And what I will do is I will use this pointer. I will write a print. I will write a print. And I will write a sample. And I will save. Now if I show here. And show the ampersand marks. So you will see how many marks are there. I have not set the array. I have not added any value. But again you will see here. I will show the element here. I will do a small amount to fix it. So you will see two elements. The value of the garbage. I will set the value of the garbage. So what I can do here. I can call a set value function. So I will write a void. And I will write a set value. I will make a function called set value. I will also write the same thing. My array. Star A. I will write a scan of print. And I will write here. Print. Enter element percentile D. Okay. And enter element percentile D. And after that I will write I. Okay. So what will happen here. I will scan. And I will write something from here. I will write this. By scan of percentage D. And I will select control here. And I will write this as equal to n. Okay. I will write something like this. And what I will do here. scan of percentage D. And I will end here. Okay. So I will set the value of n first. So if I will set the value of the show here. I will also make a set value. And I will do this. Then you will see an entire element 0. I have done 12. And here. So I have called the backslash in the backslash. So I will set the backslash. And I will again write this program as a component. And you see the element 0 is asking me. I will enter 12. Then I will enter 13. And you see here. I got 12. And 13. This show function is set. So if I do this here. I will print. And I will write something like this. We are running set value now. And then I will write the same thing here. We are running. Show now. Okay. And you guys know that I have used this visual studio code in different shortcuts. So you can watch my VS code in one video. Search on the channel. And write the VS code here. In my Python course, it is a very useful video. Okay. So now I will do what I will do. I will control. I will run. I will return it. And you see. We are running set value now. And you see. We are running set value now. I have set it 3. I have set it 4. I have set it 4. I have shown this. Show now. Now I have shown here 3. Now I can insert elements in it. I can delete elements in it. If I am deleting elements, what will I do? If I want to add a notebook. So I delete elements. I have deleted 18. So I will have to delete 20. And I will use this. I will have to update the used size. Now the used size will be stored. Because there are 2 elements in it. So we have to see the same thing. We have to update the used size. Because now the elements are deleted from the array. So we can do this. But I don't want to make a complicated one. You have to understand that the array is my. I have defined an abstract data type. A total size integer, a use size integer, a pointer, and a total size of the used size. So we have to see how much size we need to reserve. How much size we need to use is the use size. What is the PTR? When we request memory from heap. When we request memory from heap. When we request memory from heap. When we request memory from heap. When we request memory from heap. In the case of in star melok. If you don't know the dynamic memory. Then you will hear that the in star melok is an integer size. What does that do? It gives you memory in heap. And gives you pointer. The entire in star melok and in to size of the pointer. If I request this array. I will point this zero element. So what will happen once I have done this. In the case of in the PTR. The heap of the reserved memory will be found. And the pointer PTR is the pointer. In the first element. In this case, I will point it in 7. By the way, 7.8.12. I will add values later. But when you request memory. Then I will find you. Okay, pointer will be pointing to 7. So I have made this PTR for this. But I have not done this yet. When you write. Set. Sorry, struct. My array. Marks. Write this line. Then what happens? The compiler. It is made of an extractor. For the variables. It is reserved. Total size, use size and start PTR. For the 3.0. 4x4.4x4.4x4. Once it has done this. What will happen after that? I have made a creator name. What is it doing? And it is taking the address of this mark. And it will update it from the address. It does not need to return. I will use the content of this structure. Total size, use size and start PTR. I can update the 3 content. So what is this? What is it doing? It is taking the address of the mark. And after that. Another thing is that you should have the size. After that. I will use it. I will use it for now. I will have to extend it later. So I have reserved it. So you can do this. And after that. What will happen after that? When you go to create array. What will happen? It will update the structure. These two values will set the PTR. But the PTR here. I will use the melody of the melody. And I will request the heap. Why are the members requesting the heap? Because this function has been removed once. I told you that the memory of the stack is the same. So if I have made it in the stack. Then this memory will be destroyed. So I have to make it in the heap. So I have to take the help of the melody. The melody is our friend. The melody helps us. The melody says, don't worry. We are with you. The melody says that we will give you the heap. Leave the stack. We will give you the heap. When you return the function. Create array function. When you return the function. Then what will happen? Then your memory. You have requested the block of memory. We will give you the number. We will give you the number. And where will the memory be? This is the heap. This is the requested memory. You have to make it manually free. And you can access the heap. So the memory of the memory is read in this video. And if you don't know. See the video. I have packed a lot of work. People say that it is a 15 hour video. In fact it is a very small video. It is a very small video. In 15 hours. The pack is packed. You will not know how many months it took. The notes are made. If you don't access it. Then what should I do? You must access it. Don't miss this opportunity. We have created a set value. What it does? It takes the address of our box. And inside it's values. We also want to add the structure. We need to get the structure. We need to note the structure. We need to note the structure. The structure is the address of the object. It is the address of the object. When I am passing the address. I can access the content of the content. Amp% means the address of the object. The value of the object. I will give the address of the object. And what I will do after that. I will do it with the star. I will do the de-reference. I will get this structure. The structure is in the main. And the main function is running. The program is not over. I am not satisfied with the structure. I am using all the methods inside. I can define some other methods here. Like insert. What I will do in insert. I will give the insert element. I will go to the index. Insert. If I insert the element in my area. I will insert the element in my area. I will say 1 index. Insert. Insert. Insert. So, I will have to drop the element in my area. If I want to maintain the order. I will drop the element in my area. But if the order is not working. I will get the order in the position of the tree. If the order is working. I will do this. I will get the index in the tree. I will have to drop the element in my area. I will have to drop the element in my area. I will give the index in my area. I will note the index. If I insert the element in my area. I will write the function of the program. I will write all the practice and insertions in an area. I will write all the practice and insertions in an area. I will not confuse you with the ADD. Our abstract data type is our custom data type. Our own data type is our custom data type. You can buy a laptop or computer. You can make it yourself by your own components. You can make it myself but for launch it. you may start by carrying you by yourself. Use strategy using pointas like how this happen. You cannot do it for own ADD. Most of you are providing a song to mean the value of the editing. We use some primitive data type.ingle it is rarely given I am not sure zw sociaux You can get a set method on your language syntax. You can write your custom Gator Set method. I will leave it to you. But insertion, deletion and other areas of the operation I will separate you. We will end the ADT. ADT is an interesting topic. But ADT confuses people a lot. These are so many things that people think and say. What is ADT? I have never understood ADT. There is no definition in ADT. There is written something. There is a comment in ADT. I have written a mathematical model. And ADT plus computer science. I will write it in the article of the Wiki. You have written it in the updated article. Mathematical model. What is the description of a system along with mathematical concepts and language? What is the description of the abstract data type? If you are understanding that it is a mathematical model. You can understand that in the abstract data type, there is a behavior. The user can use it as a user. The concept ADT type. This class is an object and object to the end of the program. The thinking of the abstract data is not a big concept. It is a definition of the abstract data. And I have shown you its implementation. So, there is no need to be more confused. If you think, what is ADT? ADT is not a custom data type. You have made your own functions. You have defined the function. I can tell you that ADT is a method. I will not tell you what language you are creating. What are you doing? I want this. You have Carpenter. It is called resizable table. You have set the concept bracket. You have set the concept Dinda. You have set the concept bracket. I want a table that is size. You can also set the laptop table. It is a lot of implementation. You will get 10 simple implementations. We will close the concept of ADT. I will explain in the comment section. Did you understand the abstract data type? Did you understand the abstract data type? Do you want to create a custom data type? For your user experience? For your user experience? Let me tell you all the problems. Yes, I have understood the abstract data type. I will tell you about the topics. English, Thai, Binary, Trees, AVL, A.V.L. We are doing a lot of things. We have to see all these things. I know that the time is limited. I will do it. You must do it. Do it here. You don't have to like this video. If you share this video, don't share this playlist. Share this playlist. I have covered all the Instagrams. I have covered all the Instagrams. I will check the Instagrams. I will check the Instagrams. You can follow me there. Please share this video. I am making notes. I will provide you all the notes in the description. Link is in the description. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. I will see you next time. Bye."
