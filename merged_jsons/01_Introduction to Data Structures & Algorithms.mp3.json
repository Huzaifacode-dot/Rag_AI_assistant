    "text": " So let's talk about the first step of this course The course is about placement preparation I'll write down the placement prep I want to tell you that I'll cover all the topics that I'll be covering Let's be honest, there are many topics that are related to data structures If I'm doing this, I'll have a lot of time and you'll want me to explain the topics that are important I'll keep that in mind and read it I'll keep it in the A or Linguistic or Graphs I'll explain the whole course and I'll write an optimal course I'll make an optimal course and make the maximum benefit of the course Let's talk about the prerequisites of this course I'll use the programming language in this course I'll use C and C++ I'll tell you about C and C++ If you don't come to C++, you'll be able to use this course without any issues I'll just read the only thing you'll be able to say about C++ I've read C++ in one video and I have one video which is a bit short I've read C++ in one video and I've read some new operators and I've read the object orientation So you'll have to read C++ as much as you want to You'll have to do some small things about C Like C, I have to get a new operator in C++ So I'll use this new operator I'll tell you about the object orientation If you don't come to C++, you'll be able to use C++ You'll have to use C++ The notes you'll be able to use in PDF So you don't have to take the tension of the notes So there's PDF, I'll give you all the notes in the description And what I'll do here is I'll tell you about the data structure What are the algorithms? Let's read the data structure I'll put the data structure here I'll write the space in the dot And I'll write the algorithms here I've written the data structures I'll change the pen in blue Let's see if it'll work What are the data structures? The data structures are like you've read the array You already know the data structures You already know the data structure The other thing is the difference between the two First of all, I'll talk about the data structures The data structures are made for efficient algorithm They are made for efficient algorithm You'll be able to make them for efficient algorithm This means they are the way to arrange I'll write the data in main memory For efficient usage I'll write the data in the main memory I've written all these notes You don't have to write the notes This is the way to arrange the data in main memory For efficient usage I'll be a little bit excited to see what the algorithms are I'll tell you the basic definition of data structure Let's take examples of data structures We have the links Stack Queue Graphs Pinary search trees etc. I'll read all of them I'll tell you the steps Follow the steps I'll understand it in a very different way I'll read all of them I'll make a simple example When you take the data structure When you take the code, it's a simple example People are preparing for placement I'll try to make a little bit of a delay But I'm happy that I've brought a course for you Now, data structure is a way to arrange data in main memory For efficient usage What is algorithms? The sequence of steps To solve a given problem It's a very simple definition I've written in the notes What is the problem of solving a given problem? What is the problem of solving a given problem? We have to make coffee What do you do? Let's make tea Let's make tea Let's add water Let's add sugar Let's add milk Let's make tea What is this? It's an algorithm If I tell you What is an algorithm? I'll say yes to the algorithm Because you have solved some steps for this What was the problem of solving a given problem? Tea was drinking, it was drinking What were the steps for solving it? Step 1 Add water Step 2 Add tea to the step 3 Add sugar Don't add salt Add milk after that Add milk When you open it Add sugar And tea is ready What is this? It's an algorithm Similarly, when a computer is taking work Who takes work from here? When a computer is taking work I'll say that I'll add water Add sugar Add milk So I won't be able to say it I'll explain it in the language I'll explain it in the Gintamane I'll implement an algorithm in those languages I'll do CC++ here But you can also use Python To implement an algorithm You can also use Java Why did I use CC++ here? The main motive of choosing COC++ is When you use COC++ You'll understand the basic things The simple programming language You have to do everything I have a problem with Python If you read the algorithm First of all, when you're preparing for the placement You can also do the code in Java If you follow the code If you follow the code If you follow the code You can follow it in any problem You can follow it in Java But I'll write the algorithm I'll write in CC++ But you can't write in Java You can write in Java I won't recommend Python I won't recommend JavaScript If you can use advanced user But for beginners, you can use Java Script or Python And other programming languages I'll say that CC won't be able to learn If you read Python with CC You'll be able to learn it If you're a beginner I'll tell you the experience You can do it You can also do algorithms You can do everything But CC++ I'll use CC++ I'll make a video with notes You can find it on the channel If you're a beginner You can understand Java's nitty-gritty You can do it You won't be able to do it We talked about data structures We talked about algorithms We used a computer science language I've given you an example of making tea You're right If you're looking for a proper example Write in the exam And if you want to present it professionally You'll have to present it I'm taking an example Sorting and array Sorting and array What's the meaning of this? Like 1792 What's the output? If you sort it out 1279 If you want to sort it in an increasing order Then 1279 is the output So you'll have some steps What's the step to sort it out? For those steps They're the same algorithm For sorting Array Array So I've told you What's the data structure? What's the algorithm? I've told you that You'll have to switch the placement preparation You'll have to switch the job You'll have to give an interview I'll tell you some of the interviews First, I'll cover content I'll explain how time is limited When you're preparing for placement I'll explain this I'll structure it I'll keep the value of your time I'll structure this course And these notes If you look at them I'll show you I've written notes You'll understand it in a good way I've written all the definitions I'll tell you I've written about the memory I'll discuss it in a good way You don't need to write this Because I've already written notes But what I'll do here I'll rub it I'll clear the board And I'll tell you one more thing I've told you the course structure I'll start the time complexity And I've to tell you the data structure And then I'll write the sequence I'll do the order I want to talk about the knowledge I'll talk about them Data base Okay And with that, the data warehouse And you'll get to listen to it And you'll get to know And the interview says What's this? And a big data What's the database? We first saw the data structures What was the data structures? The arrangement of data In main memory In main memory, when I say Main memory means What's the main memory? When I talk about main memory It means In your computer There are 2, 4, 8, 16, and even some of them There are more than Some people But normally, it's so much So it means the main memory means When I say main memory So I'm referring to the RAM So database, data warehouse The data structure is When the program is You get to know Some programs Example of an Excel Like Google Chrome When you load it, where it is In random memory, there is a RAM And then Something happens When it is a program If you are on the Windows What will be the first time When it is loaded Then the RAM will be in Something The code of the program The sequence of steps To open a new tab To download a new file If there is a lot of Chrome in it In main memory, the data will be played With the data, it will be done The operations will be done And the arrangement To make the optimal This Chrome is responsible for the software And to make the optimal To use it To make it less If you have more RAM Then you can use it on the computer And then the entire folder And the edge is here And the new one is here So they are standing behind Where is Chrome.TXC And they will create a problem And we are in the market So they are standing So they will have to use the data structure To load the program And to do the same, we have to use the memory To create a data structure To load the program To create a data structure To load the program To create a data structure To create a data structure But the data is not the same It is the same But what happens here You can read the data And retrieve the data And update it And delete it So here is my defined group I am going to use the notes I am going to use it to open my own document Collection of information in permanent storage for faster retrieval and updation You will get PDF and description So you can get the tension And I have written the data warehouse definition Management of huge amount of Legacy data for better analysis I will explain this Management of huge amount of Data of League of League. What is League of League? I will tell you about it. Data waste is understood that in hard disk, many data stored, To retrieve it, update it, in memory, It is not here, we have to read it and update it. You can use mySQL database, you can use MongoDB. The database is, i.e. in hard disk, It is in hard disk, because Whatever data is in RAM, Whatever data is in RAM, It will end after the program is closed. So, what we have to do is, If we have to persist data for a long time, What we have to do is, We have to keep it in hard disk, And we have to keep it in good condition, For efficient, retrieval, Abdation and deletion. What we have to do is, We have to use database, And to make it design, We have to read the database, Which is outside this course, We have to read the data structure algorithms, Data is outside this course, I will run a website, I will run Facebook.com, But I will run it, Now, the Facebook.com, It will end up with a lot of data, You will upload a photo, Your friend will be a big fan of you. Your friend, You have wished for a long time in 2009. If you are a big fan, Then you will be able to do it in the next one. So, that account, that data, I will keep it in mind, Because it is a data, Which I will use later to analysis it, To make it look like a data. Okay? Now, I have prepared some data, And now, 20,000, 20,000, But I don't want to keep it in that database, Because, My access, I will try to access it, So, it will be slow, Because I don't want to keep all the data on one place, On my main system, It is a very simple diagram, I am making it very complicated, But let's assume, It interacts with one database, So, what I will do, I will keep fresh data, And I will repeat the legacy data, The legacy data will be the data, Which should be kept in mind, Because I want to keep the main system At least, I want to keep the data, But I don't want to keep the data on my old data, Because I want to analyze it, I want to see how many people clicked on the profile, Now, I clicked on the profile of your friend, I want to take it from the main system, From Facebook, This data can be kept in a different way, And it can be kept in a different way, And it can be kept in a different way, Because, data is a very big thing, Today, The field of big algorithms, So, we will have to open the data, We will have to open the data, And I will do different things in the main system, And this data will be very big, So, I will do different things, Now, how to store this legacy data, How to keep it in a different way, How to keep it in a different way, How to distribute it, So that I can store it efficiently, That is the head data warehousing, Okay, You should know about this course, Big data, Now, what will happen, Is that, You have to make an algorithm, Which is, for example, search engine, Which deals with a very big data, That your normal algorithm, And the normal applications, That do not deal with it, For example, You have to search for the model, And it is very big data, If you have a limited memory, So, for that, The algorithm, You have to use techniques, And it feels different, Big data, But, you should know these three terms, Now, what I am telling you, It is very important, Take more attention, You should know, And also, you know, Because, In any company, you are giving, You have to study data structure and algorithm, And all these things are used in the industry, And because all these things are used in the industry, And also, you can ask, Because, you can ask, So, you will answer, So, you will give, Good performance in their comparison, Now, what I am telling you, It is very important to listen to, Now, This is my memory, This is my memory, What is RAM? Random access memory, You know, You can not do bad teach, What the extra, Like this, Everything you want, Motherloo, Now, what you want to do? Almost everything you want. And aspect of dataness. As you can see, It can't be called digital, Each seeinginasets. Means, At that time, I will tell you that the memory of the C programming is good and the data is structured algorithm. Now what is here? I am talking in segments. So this is a code segment. I mean this is my code. I mean this is a code from Harry.C. Now this code is the main memory in load. I told you that if you open a program, the memory of the Cable is loaded. And what is the problem? After that, the load will be something else. Now what is here? Let's keep static plus global variables. And I will not do it too much. I have made the segment of initialized notes. I have made the diagram for this. I will not discuss it now. I will keep static and global variables. I will show you the section of the data. This is stack and heap. Now stack and heap are very important to the world. Because the question is asked. If you want to know the real C programs, then you need to know the stack and heap. So the stack is a normal memory. It is a simple memory. I have written the entire integer. I have written the number of Cs equal to CH. I have made a variable. It is in my stack. Now look at the diagram from here. I know that it is a main function in my program. And I have made a function called Fun1. Now my Fun1 function. I have made a Fun2 name function. Fun1 is my function. Fun2 is my function. Fun1 is my column. And my main function is my program. Now I will do the main function. This is my main function. This is the column. When this is the column, it will get a place here. This stack frame will be activated. I will do this here. I am making a stack frame or activation. This is the main activation. Here all the variables I have made are i. Int i is equal to 0. That will be here. Int j is equal to 3. That will be here. Then what will happen? When all these lines execute, this line will be done. Fun1 will execute. Then it will be the activation record. It will be the activation record. Fun1's activation record is what is happening inside. Fun1's Fun2 is called Fun2. I have made variables here. I will write k and L here. Initialize k and L. Then I will call Fun2. As soon as I call Fun2, I will call Fun1 as Fun1. I will call Fun2 and get the value. Fun1 is called Fun1. Go and get Fun2. Call Fun2 and get the value. I have made many variables. This is the C, D, F, G. All these variables are the values in all variables. Take a look here. The stack frame of Fun2 is also called A, C, D, F and G. All these variables are being created. All these variables are being used by many members. Finally, the value is written. What is the value of the value? I am adding k in the value of K, D, F and G. When I am doing the function of K, D, F and G, I will do it in K. K will be the value of the function written in the function. You will find out in some programming language. What will happen? I have got the value of one value. After the final calculation, the value is written. The value is 3. What will happen? I will cut the data from this way. It will be deleted. The activation record will be empty. If the value is written in the function, then it will be given to the value of 3. Finally, the value of this can be written. It can be written in the function. What will happen? The memory will be empty. The memory will be empty. Finally, the value is written here. When the program is finished, the value will be empty. Here, the value of the purish phase will be empty. The heap is a stack. The function of the stack will be called. The function of the stack will be found. What is the heap? I will explain the heap. Listen carefully. The amount of money you have, you don't have money. What do you do? You request a bank or a bank. You give me Rs.10, Rs.20, Rs.20. You go to your friend's house, you go to your father's house, you go to your uncle's house, you request money to buy. You give me money. I will give you money. I give you Rs.20, Rs.20 for 10 days. You arrange your money and return it. Thank you so much. You gave me Rs.20. You have requested and when your work is done, you have released it. Take the example of your phone. I am very angry with my friend. He gave me his phone. I will send him a simple phone. You will tell him, it is fine. Play PUBG. I will give him a lottery. You have requested and when your work is done, you have returned it. You have lost it. What happens in Heap? In Heap, you allocate a dynamic memory. If you want to request a dynamic memory, you request it from Heap. What happens in Heap? You request a dynamic memory. How will you request it? From the point of your heart. The point of your heart is a variable which you can store. I have told you a lot about the C in the tutorial. If you have seen it, you have already told it. It is not a question. I will make a point here. I will use Malok in C language. I am a new operator in C++. I can use a new operator. I can use Malok in C. I can request a dynamic memory. I want to store a 4 integers. I can point this pointer. I will use Malok in C. I will request this in dynamic memory. I want this dynamically. I can also make this in stack. If I used to make this stack, I would have kept it for forever. Until I return the function. I want to delete the function in the same function. You can request it from Jammancha. You can delete Jammancha. From the function in one, you can request Jammancha. You can request Jammancha. You can request Jammancha. You can request Jammancha. You can use a heap memory. You can allocate RAM. Where can you use the memory? I want to store 4 integers. I will give you a hint. I have given the letter to the milk. Where can you give milk? It is the balty pointer. What is the balty pointer? What is the pointer? The pointer is the address store. You can give the address to the first element. You can use it later. When you have the work done, you can tell the memory of the heap. Now I want to release it. You will need to release it later. If you have the memory, you will be able to use it. Or else, you will be able to use it. So, the memory is very efficiently used. Data structure and algorithm is the same game. We efficiently and efficiently use our algorithm in a very less time. Space is also important. Time is important. The topic is the same. I hope you understood why the heap is used. If you ask me why the heap is used in the stack, what will you answer? You can do it. But if I have to delete the function, I will have to make an error of 1 lakh elements. And after that, I have to delete the function. How will I do it? The dynamic memory is the stack of a function. It is the end of the function. The function is written and the end of the function is the end. The function is called as the stack. So, I have started from the main. I have called the main into inti-0. I have called the fun one. I will take the value from the main to the main. I have written the value of the function. And after that, you resume your execution. Now you can pause. The main value is the value of the function. What will happen? What is the function? The function is called as the function of the function. I will give you the value of the function. I will wait for you. You go and take the value. So, I am waiting for this. The function is written as the function of the function. And the memory of the function will be in the stack. As soon as the value is written, the execution and resume will be done. I hope that it is clear. So, this is the program in which our memory is run. First, the code will be copied. Now, the code will be copied. You will not run the machine code. You will compile the machine code. Now, after that, you can use the stack and heap. You can use heap as a responsibility. If you use the heap, you can use the memory of the memory. The memory of the situation is that you don't have to make a free heap. And you will request a heap. You will request a heap. You will request a heap. You will request a heap. I have written all the notes. So, you won't have any problem. I hope you liked this video. In future videos, we will focus on data structure algorithm. This prerequisite was a little bit of a requirement. I will use it in terms. We will see this as a language. We will see the array. We will see the binary search. So, we will use this as a lot. So, I told you this. This is worth it. If you want to do Python, I will tell you that when you enter the interview, you will expect the C++ from you. You will get the language from the English. You will go there and say, C++ and the language is not coming. You are only Python and the language program. So, you will get the data structure. You will get the C which is coming in front of you. I am telling you this as an experience. It is a mindset. And you can say, I can't emphasize enough. You have to learn. I recommend C. When you are preparing a product based company for a data structure, and you are focusing on data structure, then I recommend C++. And I have given more videos in it. If you don't come to C, then I have made a video of 15 hours with notes. I have given this video with notes. I have given that video with notes. So, you can access it. I hope this is clear. I will explain it to you. And with that, I will tell you to download notes and download it. And like this video. Tell me in the comment how it felt. So, now, we will explore the topics of this video. We will explore the topics of this video. Don't forget to like this video. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. Bye."
