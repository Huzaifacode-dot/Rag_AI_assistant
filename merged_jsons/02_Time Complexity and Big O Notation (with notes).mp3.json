And he lives on a 5 km distance. He is used to make a name for his friend. And this friend lives on a 5 km distance. I am very bad. I am very bad. I need entertainment. It is a big game like PUBG and GTA 5. So it is a big game. It is very important to play games. And it is also possible to get all the games. But there is a problem. I also get GEO. It also gets GEO. I get GEO. And we are not going to sell more than the broadband. And we cannot sell more than the internet. So if I want to buy a game for this. So what is the fastest way for me? If I want to play so much, what is the fastest way for me? What is the way to get a game for this friend? Tell me. There is no doubt about this. Take a hard disk and take a copy. So what I will do? I will take my bike and I will take it. I will take it and play the game. So I am going from the bike. And I will go and play the game. I will come back and take the loop of the game. I will take the loop of the game and I will take the loop of the game. Okay? But why am I not listening to this? If I say that the game is 100k. It is a very simple game. So what I will take it from the hard disk. Tell me. No, I will tell you that you put it on the drive. You email, upload it somewhere. I will also put it on the drop box. It is Gmail. Google Drive. You will also get a lot of information in Gmail. You also understand. Now tell me one thing. I am asking you a question. How much is the size when you have to change your way? To get the game, to get the game, to get the game. Now look. To get the game, you got the way to get the game. You got the internet. Because it was fast for you. And for 60 GB, you got the physical visit. You will have to visit it physically. So I will take you to the hard disk. The game will be a 1GB of internet. How will you get the GB? So you got the game. If I ask you a question, how will the size of this input be? Now I will give you an input. Let's go into technical terms. An analogy. An analogy of stories. This is an input. What is the output? What is the output? What is your problem? What is your problem? You want the game. So we have to solve this problem. Let us call it algorithm 1. Let us call it algorithm 2. Okay. The algorithm 1 is for the input of the 200 KB. For the algorithm 2, you have to use the same input. This means that the size of the input is increasing. By the way, you can understand the runtime of this algorithm. You can understand the time to get it. In this algorithm, the runtime of this algorithm is changing. As the input will increase, the runtime of this algorithm will increase. Let us analyze whether this is the truth or not. If I am sending it from the internet, if I am sending it in the 200 KB, then the amount of people will be 2 seconds. It can be that if I send a cam, then how much will it be? If I send it in the 200 KB, then I will keep it simple. I mean, the amount of people is increasing. If you send a cam, then I will keep it 4 seconds. If you send a cam, then I will keep it 4 seconds. This means that the time to send a cam is increasing. The time to send a cam is increasing. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. We try to get the time complexity of these two algorithms. We try to get the time complexity of these two algorithms. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. If you send a cam, then I will keep it simple. When we analyze algorithms, we analyze them. And ask questions to the best algorithm. And what is an algorithm that performs better. We say that the input size is increasing. And what is the difference between the algorithm and the time. We ask questions to the best algorithm. And we ask questions to the best algorithm. And we ask questions to the best algorithm. If you write T-algo 1, then I will write T-algo 1. I say that you have to make a formula. So that T-algo 1 will denote you. Now, people will write K1 seconds in a separate letter. Because if you write K1 seconds in a separate letter, then what will you write? You will have to write K1 time in a separate letter. The car you are driving and the time to reach your friend's home is K2. And after that, you will go to your aunt's house. If you make a little tea, you will have to make a little tea. So, you will have to write K3 time in a separate letter. If you ask your dad, he will not come to school or the bank or college. He will not come to school or the bank or college. And after that, I will come back. I will go to different routes to get there. So, what is the time that is depending on the size of the input. If you write the size of input N, what is N? I write the size of the game. The size of the game. You can take it. If you write 10 GB here, you can write 100 GB here, 2 GB. You can copy it and write it in a separate letter. If I say that I write it in N's terms, then I can't write in N's terms. I am writing a new name. How can you behave in N's terms? If I write it in N's terms, then I can't write it. If I write it in N's terms, then I can't write it. If you say that it is fine, then you can write it in N's terms. K1 N to the power 0 plus K2 plus K3 plus K4. I am also happy. I am also happy. K1 N to the power 0 is 0. What I have done is writing it in N's terms. I am telling you about Bego. What is Bego? I am telling you to forget Bego. I will not talk about all these things. I am telling you. I am telling you. We are not listening to the song. We are not listening to the song in L word. We are not listening to the song in L word. T L1 and if I write N's terms in L, then I will be taking time by L1. I think it should be L2. I am sorry. It was L2 because physical is L2. It was L2. It is L2. Let me correct it. L2 is not depending. I am telling you to make a bigger term in the terms. So this is the big term, the biggest term is the n to the power 0. So this is the big of n to the power 0 because the most impactful term is the n of n to the power 0. So this is the big of n to the power 0. What happens to the power 0? Why do we complicate things? When we write n to the power 0, this is big of 1. So this constant is the algorithm that is being run in time. Big of 1 is called constant time. Because this was constant. When this constant is done, n to the power 0 is done and we do it. So big of 1 constant is done and we do it again. Because we will think about it later. Big of 1, see the constant. Let us try to try to try to do it. Now let us listen to the second song. Now see what happens here. If I do the first algorithm analysis, T l go 1. Then what happens here? What I have to do is upload. When I am sending data, I have to send it and then I am sending it. I am getting the main time problem. Now if I turn on my computer, then my L1 is there. Then what happened? I have my L1 time in all the preparations. This will be constant. 5 seconds, 2 seconds, 10 seconds. Your computer has SSD, so it will open in 4 seconds. You can use a super computer for 1 second. L1 plus your speed is L2. L2 is a constant speed. You can connect your speed. Which is not in the G.O. But it will be constant. Your internet speed is L2 Kbps. So if L2 Kbps is your speed, I will write here. L2 Kbps is your speed. And along with that, you have the game of L3 Kb. Sorry, L3 Kb is the game N. So the N is the size of the game. The game of NKb is the game. Then what will you do? You will find the game in the game. You will find the game N by L2. So N divided by L2. Speed is equal to distance upon time. Physics is simple. So distance is the distance. And speed is the time to find out how much it will take. If I use my L1, I will divide the speed of my internet. Speed is equal to distance upon time and time is equal to distance upon speed. So I divide the size of my distance by time. And divided by L2. Now I can choose L2-1 by L2. I will simplify it. I have decided that the one upon L2 is another constant. I have called L2-1. And after calling L2-1, I will write it like this. L1N to the power 0 plus L2-1. Now tell us the most impactful term. What is this? What is the degree of this? What is the constant? And to the power of 1. I will write it like this. This is not equal to. I will write a tail here. I will say that the most impactful term is the one upon L2. Because if I divide the number of inputs into 10, then it will be 2. So the higher degree of term is in polynomial. In any equation, the more impactful term is taken. I have taken it here. I have taken it here because the number of inputs is very big. And I want to simplify it in a simple way. Now I will write it like this. The big of n to the power 1, or the big of n. So my algorithm is big of n. I will also say that I run it in linear time. Now you guys go to real world. If you go to an industry, you will find a product based company. So what will happen? You will not listen to a story. You will give an algorithm, and you will analyze the output of the output. And choose your algorithm. So I have made notes for you guys. It is very fun. We will see one more example. But I want you guys to understand this. And this is a very basic and foundation. It is a very important thing. I want to tell you something. It is very important. I have tried to simplify it. If you have not understood it yet, then you can watch this video. You can see it from the back. It is not wrong. You can see it from the back. I do not recommend it. If you have not understood it, then go and see it from the back. It is a very simple story. You can send it from the internet. You can go to the physical, and send it from the internet. You will get the size of the file. You will get the time to visit the physical. You will get the time to visit the physical. You will get the time to visit the physical. I have written a big of one. And how did I write this? I have written a big of n. I have told you that we have many algorithms. We will talk about the big of n log n. Now what is the log? We will talk about this. Big of n square. The tutorial n is also a tutorial. We will see all the things. But here, I just want to tell you that if your time is scale, with the input size, and the constant is, then it is a big of fun. So, the time complexity analysis is the time. The time is for you to run your algorithm. So, the time is scale. If you are running a linear time, then it is a big of n. If you are running a constant time, then it is a big of one. So, we have cleared the things. I hope it is cleared. I will quickly board it. I have written a very simple and simple and I give this a big convenience. Now, we will add a little bit of big of a process. I have written a little bit of the process. And the very important thing is to listen carefully. If you have any questions, then we will also do questions. But questions will be the way you play. The way you play the way you play. I have to show it. I will not do it. Now, what we will do here? We will explain the big of things. Now, see, the big of mathematical definition is different. And the big of industry definition is different. And I will tell you this later. This is a mathematical definition. And one is the industrial definition. Which is that you will ask in the industry. So, what will happen in the industry definition? That you will tell people precisely the big of the big of the big of the big of the big of the big of it. So, we will come up with big big of big of the big of. But, now, you will understand that the big of the big of the big of the industry is the big of the bigger of the the big of the big. If you have defined mathematics, then it is a little different. If you have any questions about the industrial of your interview or the data, There is no problem. I have told you that I am making a preparation for the placement. I am not just making a preparation for the placement. You cannot see the gate for it. All the concepts are the same. If you are solving the question, you get a mathematical definition. But if you are giving the answer in the industry, then the definition is the same. What difference are the big of n? It automatically gets big of n square. And automatically is also big of n cube. So, the higher order term is written in this way. This is a mathematical definition. But the industry definition is expected to be written in the less than the quantity of n cube. So, here, the industry definition is the minimum of these. You analyze the algorithm and write it in the minimum. Let us see the value of n cube. Let us see the mathematics in this. Why is it so? But if you are writing something like this, then you can write it in the minimum. But you can only tell it. Whenever I am using mathematical definition, then I am saying it in the big. But when I am giving the answer in the industry definition, then I will say order of. I will say order of. Because the big definition is something else. But the interchange is used in the big. But this is the story. What is in the industry? And the mathematical definition is used in the academy. So, you should know the things. I will give it a quick answer. And what will I do with it? I will make a graph. A graph is very important. I will put it on the desktop. I will put it on the desktop. And what will I do now? I will make a graph. So, let us write two algorithms. The algorithm that was Algo1. Please write it. The algorithm that was Algo1 was the internet sent to the file. And the algorithm that was Algo2 was the physical visit. I will write it in the P.V. It is not a physical visit. So, what I am doing here? Algo1 is the internet. And we saw that it was big of n. It was big of 1. It was the algorithm that was constant time. Now, listen carefully. If I want to plot something. I want to input and time. What is the time? The time you reach your friend's home. And what is this n? This is your size of game. This is your size of game. This is the size of game. If I plot Algo2, it was a constant. So, I will plot something. I have written a video behind it. The constant is the same. So, it will plot it in this way. This is not the one's graph. It is equal to 1's graph. This is equal to k's graph. The constant was the time. And what is the graph that I am making? It is the big of n's graph. This y is equal to mx plus c. It can be distorted. We have just taken a higher order term. So, what is this big of n's graph? You sent 200k to me. So, when you sent 200k to me. Where did you start? I am coming here. You sent it from the internet. Then, your file was getting bigger. So, you have to take a decision. You are getting it. You send it or not. Then, I will come here. I agree. I agree that you have to pay that much time. I agree. You will pay that much time. You are getting it from the internet. You will also get it from the physical results. You will get it at one time. You will get it at one time. You will get it at one time. So, if you want to get it at 20 GB, you will have to wait so long. You will have to take it at home. It takes less time. I have made this graph. This y is equal to 1 or y is equal to n. This is the graph of the equation of one algorithm. The graph of the equation of n algorithm is the graph. This y is equal to 1 and this is equal to n. This y is equal to the equation of our algorithm. The graph of the equation of n algorithm is approximately we plot it approximately and compare it to all of them. We compare it to all of them. I will show you the other graph. But, I will have to take it at this time. I have made the notes that I have made. Let's see some concepts and things. Let's try to understand it. I have already given you the DS1.PDF. I have made the introduction to DS1.PDF. I have opened the DS1.PDF. I am giving you an example. I have given you an example of a time complexity. I want to eat pizza. I can send a pizza to my brother. But, if I have a friend, I have written a video about it. I have written a video about it. You can't order pizza from your home. You can't order it from your home. You can't order it from your home. You got the point. The size of your pizza you want to order. It is affecting time. The time you get to get pizza, it is affecting you. I have also seen the time complexity. I will define the time complexity. It is a study of efficiency of algorithms. How time take into execute and algorithm grows with size of the input. How time will increase, time will increase, time will increase, time will increase. I have taken an example of two developers. What they are doing is, they are trying to sort the N numbers. I am taking a real word example. We have taken the N numbers. I am taking a real word example. I am taking a real word example. I can take a real word example. I can take a real word example. I am taking a real word example. I want to sort the N numbers. I will run the N numbers for the input size. I have taken an example of the Ruan. I have taken an example of the Ruan. I have tested the N numbers. I have taken 90 milliseconds for the output of the Ruan. Ruan, I have taken another 20 milliseconds for the output of the Ruan. I have taken a real word example. I have taken a real word example. If you have taken this, you will run it for 14 seconds. If you have a few seconds, you will run it for 110 seconds. After that, you will run it for 110 elements. And there, Shubham Calgorda has shot for 110 seconds. And on one Calgorda, there was a manor of 120, 630. And on the other, there was a manor of 130 seconds. After that, when I caught 1000 elements, I got these Calgorda. Shubham Calgorda is a big burden. So, I got these Calgorda in 2 seconds. But, I got them in 8 seconds. So, what will you conclude? You can see here, initially, if you want to use less elements, Shubham Calgorda is better. But, if you want to run for big elements, If you want to run big data, I will use this Calgorda. For small areas, I will use this Calgorda in comparison to Shubham. So, I will use this Calgorda in comparison to Shubham Calgorda. So, here, the answer is that both are better. If I compare overall, I will give Rohan a name. He wrote that, as he is getting bigger, He wrote that, but Shubham had small elements. He could have shot some elements in such a way that he would have shot. So, I am just saying, The Calgorda is a very good one. It is a good time run for a big input. It is a good time run for a small element. So, here, if I want to run small elements, If I want to run for a small element, I will always use this Calgorda. I will not even see Rohan's Calgorda. But, if I want to do big elements, I will use this Calgorda in a system that I will use for a big input. It is very optimally performed. I do not want to read all the notes. I have written these things, You should have told me earlier, The story of the Geo, We saw that, The file size we were doing, The online sending, The time was increasing in the physical sending, Now, How to calculate the order? I explained to you, Here, I have told you, The highest standard, The formula is, The most powerful formula is, The N square. You can see that, This is not the same. You can see the value of the N square. The value of this term, Overall, Overall, the value of the entire term, The value of the entire term, The value of the entire term, We will know this. We will take the highest order term, The highest degree term, This is not the only value of the polynomial, It can be a factorial in equation, It can be anything. We will take the highest order term, After taking the highest order term, What we do? We put the N in the bigo, And the bigo fence, Here, I have N, The file size, We write the terms in the bigo fence, And then, The highest degree term, Here, the bigo fence, And then, the bigo fence, We end the ball 0 is 1, Because, this man was not taking the constant time, So, we analyze the algorithms like this. Now, see here, Note that these formulas are for time ticking by jam. These formulas, Use some constants, And then, we put the stator cut, Then, I have visualized you, And I have shown you that, We can plot the bigo, Of 1, and bigo, and N, And here, We can plot more algorithms like this, Bigo, 1, bigo, and N, And all algorithms, We can plot them on a sheet. Now, I have added one more thing here, As I have shown you, And on the board, And you can plot the N on the graph. I have put a very beautiful chart here, In which, What is the compare of bigo, And how will you see it on the graph, How will you see it, This is bigo, N, This is bigo, N square, This is bigo, 2 to the board, And here, they have marked the color, From the case, The algorithm is going like this, Green means, Red means, The bad guys are running at the same time, And I have taken these figures, And you can go and see the answers. But, most of the value, I have taken it here, It is very good, You can see it, You have to read this notes once, It is very important for you, Read notes with the video, I don't think you will see something in bigo, And you will see something in bigo, Now, I will solve the problems in the next video, And we will see more of them, But I hope you liked this video, If you like this video, Like, like, and subscribe to this video, Also, if you haven't access the playlist yet, From the data structure, You will need to access the playlist, And that place, where everything is going to be done, I will add all the videos in the playlist, I will add all the videos in the playlist, So, if you want to book it, Click here, and save it, Now, I will see you in this video, Thank you so much guys for watching this video, And I will see you next time.
