    "text": " So guys, in this course of data structures, we read about the abstract data type. And you guys have understood that abstract data type is not something, it is just an influx of a new data type, which we defined some of our set of values and operations. Now abstract data type is the type that we can link to the object to the 20th programming. The abstract data type was made to make a custom data type, that you can make your user the data type of the work of its user. Now what I have done here is to make a one node notebook. I have made a folder of a notebook called folder. I want to show you the folder of the folder in the form I am doing. Because when I zip it and then I will give you this thing, then you will know where it is and what is the work. So I have made a one node notebook. And here algorithm is called one node notebook, I will make all the notebooks of this. I have solved the time complexity of this question. Now I will make a new section, I will name it, ADTs and continue here, the discussion of ADTs. So what I will do here is a pen, first of all, and I will tell you about ADTs. So ADTs first, we will write once more that the ADTs are here. I will write here, I will take a line here, the rule line looks good, so I will write ADTs here, I will write ADT here, and it will be a little bit easier to write it in this way, so you will write it in a little bit, okay, so I will write ADTs here. Now what are the ADTs? I will write here, what are the ADTs? ADTs are our first set of values, okay, set of values, plus set of operations on them, okay, plus set of operations, and what is the meaning of this? We will do a work here, we will compare it here in data types, okay, so I will tell you about the indita type, which we know, our integer data type, which indita type is what we know, you can store, you can store it in 10, you can store it in 12, you can store it in any integer, what when you write 9 plus 12, and you get a 1st answer, do you know how this came, how this 1st answer came, now look, the computer in this integer stored, it is 0 and 1 form stored, you know, whenever you have stored, there will be a decimal value, in your computer, there are some bits stored in your computer, you have to do operation, they are integers, but what is the plus operator here, okay, this is an operator, nothing else, now this operator, like a human, it will not be connected, it will not be connected, just keep 12 here, keep 9 here, place the plus sign here, it will be 9, 11, 1 carry over, and this is not the calculation of human, this is the operation in bits, and this is the way it is, to perform operations, now here, what is the 9 plus 12, but we do not know, how this 1st answer came, that is, this detail is abstracted, what is it? details abstracted, let me write it, details are abstracted, so details, abstracted, okay, so details are abstracted, we have hidden it from us, and we do not know, how it happened, but yes, we know, what happened, and we know, the answer we get, the 1st answer, the 1st answer, I am saying, my mind is, inside it, I want to keep it in this way, that it is an area, and it is a total size, total size, along with it, it is a used size, and I will tell you about it, I have defined this identity, used size, and after that, a dress, a base address, I should write a base address here, I will write a base address, a base address or a pointer, so I will write a base address, a base address, which is the base address, that is, a base address, so what will I do, I will represent this data, okay, my mind is, the identity is, the set of values, the representation is, okay, I will do this, and I will write it, plus, the set of operations, I can define some operations, what operations, what operations, what operations, what operations, what I can define, what I can define, what I can define, how I can, I will say, I want a get operation, then set operation, what will I do, I will come in the get, because I want that index, whatever I want, I want to take value in this area, then I want to set the item index, from this number, then along with it, I have also told you, operations, now, if I want to add, and I want to add, then I want to add, and return, and return, then, this way, operations, we can define a lot, and we can make our custom data type, so, abstract data type, I have made a new area, but here, once again, I want to go to that detail, in which I told you, that, the areas in which the memory is, how to take it, in this node, we will make another one, and here, I have recently, started using it on this channel, because I think, it will be a little right, we will use one node, so, I have made a new page, I can return it, and here, you can see, I am making a new page, you can also see, how I am doing it, because, I don't want to abstract, I want to cut it, but I want you to see, how I am doing it, how I am using it, how I am using it, how I am doing it, and you can use it, at least, I am making videos, you can see, okay, so, what I will do here, I have made a presentation, so, I will make a diagram from back, so, I will do a work here, I will insert the shapes, and I will insert the shape, and I will make it better, so, insert shape, where is the shape? Actually, it is in the draw, okay, so, what I will do here, is that, I will come here, and make a rectangle, okay, a simple rectangle, I don't know, I have made a rectangle, this is my memory, okay, so, what I will do, I will take this memory, this is my memory, okay, so, I will insert the memory, so, this is my memory, that means, that is RAM, and, my memory, from its height, what I will do, I will load the programming in my memory, from its height, I will run the program, first of all, what happened, the program is in the main memory, okay, so, I have written the memory, okay, this is my memory, now, in this memory, I told you, that, we have a lot of segments, like, we have a code segment, which is all the codes, so, I will do a work here, I will give you a line, from this side, a very rough line, here, this is the code segment, okay, I will write the code segment, then, I told you, in the first video, that, initialize, initialize, segments, that is also here, I will write the U and I, then, I want to do the main, stack and heap, so, this is stack, and this is heap, the stack, this is the starting memory, this is the dynamic memory, this is the dynamic memory, we have seen, now, if I want to make an array, what can I do? here, I am, create an array in the stack, which is, the main function of the stack, that is, ok, this is my main stack, can write a main here, then, here, create an array here, okay, from this side, and its value, these doubles, or, what can I do here? just, create a point, and make an integer point, what is the point? which is the stored value, I told you, in the previous video, Start off size of operator and end In your architecture, the amount of integer value is not that high If you want to get 4 or 2, the amount of byte you get is set from value So I hope EG is clear You can make it like this, you can make it in heap If you want to make this array, you can not make this array directly You can not make it with realoc I was commenting that you can resize it with realoc But you can not make it directly with realoc You can do it with realoc You can request another memory But you can not extend the same memory And there is no guarantee that it will extend So you cannot extend using realoc Okay So you cannot extend it with realoc You can make a new memory and then you can point out the base address If you want to resize it, you can resize it But you can see that in the later video You can request a array in stack You can request it in heap In the form of dynamic memory, I will come back And write a miss here Type it here And write a stack here Why am I writing like this? I will write a stack here So you can see the number of the stack And I will write the ADTs And this is the stack So I wrote the ADTs here AppStackDataTypes I saw the SATA value and operation And we can make our own array Which we define, total size, use size, base address And after that, what we will do? We will define some operations And I will write here This is the representation And after that, we will come to the operations Operations So this is the operation And we want to apply it on the abstract data type Okay? So I will apply it here too I did not write it in a more detailed way And I am proud of that You will understand what is good Now how we will code it? If I talk about this, I will give you the idea So what I will do? I will set the code I will write the code This code is from the way it is I am writing the assembly code So that you can see what I have done in the page So I will talk about the code If we are doing the C language, we will do the structure So I will write the code in C language So I will write C language I will write C language And I will write C language in C language So what I will do? I will use the structure And to use the structure I will use the structure And here I will convert the Maya So what is the use size of Maya? It is a base address So what is this? I will tell you I have made a array Let's change the color And I will make the array So I have made an array In which the Maya It is called Storke Let us say 20 elements Okay, let us say I will make a small element I will make it small Maya is going to my array 0,1,2,3,4 and 5 So I can store 6 elements 0 to 5 Okay, now my 6 will be total size I will store 6 elements Now I will use all the elements I can use 3 elements I will use some values 17,18,22 And this is my same This is my extra memory It is for later use I will extend the array So I will use it So I will use this as a file I can store all the elements But if I define the array as long as it is long I will have to copy the entire array So I will have to understand the value If I understand the value I will make Maya array name What I will do? I will make my array name as ADT Now your goal is What do you define the abstract data type? If you want to do other types of data type Then you can present And operations So I have written the blueprint And can give a data structure You can implement it In any programming language And we will use the structure Which is total size Use size, base address What will be base address The first element address is where the array is pointing So this is the point Which will store My first element is 0,3 So that I can access this array You will know that the array is Contiguous blocks of memory So the length of this is The length of the 6 elements is I can't extend it Because it is not necessary that the memory of the array is Contiguous blocks The most important requirement in the array Is that we want a contiguous block If you have a colony If you have a colony Number 1,2,3,4,5,6 So you can see the number 7 Which is owner If you don't buy it Then why will you get it? If you say that I have 7 Then you will get another one Which is 6 elements Which is the next element So the result will be Why won't you get it? So you have to read it If your fate is good, you can get it But you will get it If you talk about it The next 50 elements Which will be 10 elements Which will be the memory of your array So no guarantee is free Because your computer Will store your data With the help of your computer And you will only do the same thing Because you only asked for 6 blocks If you have made a integer array Then you asked for 6 blocks And you asked for 6 blocks So why won't you get the memory of your future? So you can do this You can buy 6 blocks from the beginning And use 3 blocks And you can use another block Because the power of the array Which is your updation And the axis It is very fast So the biggest advantage In the array That is the way you can access The element can be calculated From the base to the base You can calculate from the base What will be the 4th element? And why is that? Because it is the same So if you buy This is your data Which is 1 to the power of the array Each kilometer is 1 Milestone And 1 kilometer And 2 kilometers And 4 kilometers So you can also You can also use this today First, second, third Fourth, fifth If you ask How far is this 5-way And there The condition is so much From Delhi Which is our From there And from there How many kilometers So this is 1.90 kilometers So this is 1.91 kilometers This is 1.93 kilometers This is 1.94 kilometers So if someone asks you how far is this From Delhi? So you can even tell This is 1.92 kilometers Because you know that this is 1.90 kilometers So you can learn from the base From the base From the base From the base From the base From the base From the base From the base You can also do it So we use the access in the arrays So I hope you understood What we will do next We will set our coding environment And implement the array on a structure So I will implement it I will quickly explain in this video Then we will do coding So what I will do now I will make a structure I will make a structure I will make a structure I will use the time depth So you will make a structure I will open the bracket You will give here a size So you have given it a size So who would have given it a size Which size was it? Our total size was 1.90 So you have given it a total size What is your size? Your size is 1.90 So you can make this structure And you can make this structure And you can implement it Such that Your total size is So many memory blocks So memory to be reserved Memory to be reserved So I will resume this memory And the size of your user is Memory to be used To be used So what can we do? We can dynamically Locate the memory And then we can use Some of the memory Some parts And one of our pointers Will we store the area With the base address So we will see the implementation So what happens in the next video We will see the implementation And I will complete this in ID So we will see the implementation In the next video What do you want? To complete this implementation So you can do this in the comments And I will be very happy If you do this And I will show you the chat room But in the next video We will not be able to do this in the next video So I will share this note And I will do a comment What to do And give the folder To you What will happen? I have made PDF I have made many drawings And I will share the data All the work in this course All the work in this course You guys have to share my playlist With friends If you do this I will make all the notes For the sake of the video I will make all the details And I will never be able to do this And you have to watch the video After 6 months Because you will keep the notes So you have to course one time And after that you will have to share the work With the data structure And tell me the answer Please like this video I will start the video I will like the video I will just like the one If you keep the tempo I will keep the tempo So I hope You will learn We will implement In the videos of this ADT And I hope you will share And tell me the answers Thank you so much guys For watching this video And I will see you next time"
